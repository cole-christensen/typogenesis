"""PyTorch dataset classes for Typogenesis model training.

This package provides Dataset implementations that plug into
the existing training scripts for all three models.

Modules (to be implemented in Phase 7C):
    glyph_dataset: GlyphDataset for diffusion training
    style_dataset: StyleDataset for contrastive learning
    kerning_dataset: KerningDataset for kerning regression
